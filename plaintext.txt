A cryptographic algorithm is a mathematical functions and unchanging set of steps to perform encryption and decryption of the original data. These algorithms work in combination with a secret key which can be a combination of alphabets, numbers, words or phrases. For the purpose of encryption, the algorithm combines the original data or the text to be encoded (plaintext which is input to the encryption process)
